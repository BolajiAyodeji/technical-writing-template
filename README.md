Here are some examples:

## Introduction

This is the first section of your article that introduces your reader to your article and the goals they will accomplish after reading. This section ought to motivate the reader, summarize; what the article is about, why the reader should read, and what the reader will learn/ do in the article. Ensure to make this one to three paragraphs long.

Here is an example from my previous article ([Image Optimization and Transformation with Cloudinary](https://blog.bolajiayodeji.com/image-optimization-and-transformation-with-cloudinary)):

## Prerequisites

In this section, you are to list out all the things your reader should do or have before reading your article as bullets or checklists. This is always useful to ensure your reader(s) can follow along without missing out at any section of the article. Please note that this should not be only practised with articles that entail some installation setup but any kind of article. It can just be as minimal as asking your reader(s) to grab cold water before reading the article. A great way to get them ready, yeah?

Here is an example from my previous article ([Building a SlackBot with Node.js and SlackBots.js](https://blog.bolajiayodeji.com/building-a-slackbot-with-nodejs-and-slackbotsjs)):
